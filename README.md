# BOD_PREDICTION
  This script appears to be a Tkinter-based GUI application in Python for BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) prediction and aeration control. It involves reading sensor data from an Arduino, predicting BOD using a Random Forest Regression model, and providing recommendations for aeration based on the sensor readings and the prediction.
